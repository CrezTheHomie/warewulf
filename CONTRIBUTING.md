# Contributing

## Contributor's Agreement

You are under no obligation whatsoever to provide any bug fixes, patches, or
upgrades to the features, functionality or performance of the source code
("Enhancements") to anyone; however, if you choose to make your Enhancements
available either publicly, or directly to the project, without imposing a
separate written license agreement for such Enhancements, then you hereby grant
the following license: a non-exclusive, royalty-free perpetual license to
install, use, modify, prepare derivative works, incorporate into other computer
software, distribute, and sublicense such enhancements or derivative works
thereof, in binary and source code form.

## Getting Started

When contributing to Warewulf, it is important to properly communicate the gist
of the contribution. If it is a simple code or editorial fix, simply explaining
this within the GitHub Pull Request (PR) will suffice. But if this is a larger
fix or Enhancement, you are advised to first discuss the change with the
project leader or developers.

All commits must be "Signed-off" by using `git commit -s`, acknowledging that
you agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO.txt).
